## Evaluation of Returns in Tableau 
Review of returns for Superstore, to determine how the company can avoid bankruptcy, specifically regarding returns. 


## Analysis
This project provided an indepth statistical data analysis to answer the following questions:
- What is the correlation between total sales and total return?
- How do subcategories impact profit and returns? 
- What products in costly subcategories should be eliminated?
- What is the return rate by customer with more than one purchase? 
- How do return rates differ by geographic regions? 
- What products in costly states should be eliminated?
- What influence does shipping mode have on return rate?
- How do return rates differ over time? 
- What products in costly months should be eliminated?

## Features 
Each tab allows viewers to review relevant information in a simple, functional form to assess and review pertinent data accordingly. 

## Findings 
- Overall, the returns increase at a significantly lower incline than sales. Some subcategories, such as supplies, envelopes, and accessories present very close in total numbers.
- Return rates vary for subcategories. Machines have the highest return rate at 35% and envelopes have the lowest at 17%.
- Although return rates are high on all subcategories, three specifically also sh ow impact on profit: tables, supplies, and bookcases. Superstore should consider alleviating products that are most costly in those categories. 
- In reviewing the costly categories, it was noted that many items were costly without being returned.  Superstore should investigate the cause of these costs.  
- With an extensive number of return customers, analysis focused on costly return customers. Data revealed strong outliers: Luke Foster: $22,452 in binders, Stefania Perrino: $3,091 in phones, Tanja Norvell: $4,072 in tables and Laurel Beltran: $3,753 in machines. Machines and tables showed the most frequent returns among costly customers. Superstore should consider connecting with outlier customers for feedback.
- Machines also have numerous returns among costly returning customers.  It should be considered in the elimination of products and investigated more thoroughly with tables, supplies, and bookcases. 
- Returns are strongest in the West, followed by the East and South. Utah, California, and Oregon are the leaders of returns in the West. The South only has two states of high return, Tennessee and Mississippi. 
- The most costly western states, Utah, California, and Oregon were reviewed for products of high return with negative profit. Superstore should consider removing the following products above. *Note: Stefania Perrino's phone return is the second item.*
- Return Rate is significantly higher with Same Day shipping. Other shipping modes are close in total return rate. Superstore should consider eliminating same day shipping, particularly in the Western region. 
- The season with the highest overall return rate is late summer/ early fall.Winter shows a heavier return rate than spring and early summer. *Note: Decemberâ€™s return rate is higher than October.*
- Returned products of negative profit for August, September, October, and December are provided. Superstore should consider eliminating those products.  *Note: Although Stefania Perrino and Laurel Beltran's returns are the top two items, removing these items did not significantly alter the return rates.*
